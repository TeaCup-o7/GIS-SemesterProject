# GIS-SemesterProject
The goal of my semester project is to locate the major gas and oil pipelines in Cypress Texas. These pipelines have a 330ft safety buffer added. Spatial analysis was performed on the pipe buffer and land parcels to generate a list of land owners affected by the region's gas pipelines. Main data sources are USPS Zipcode shape file, TxDOT, and the Census Bureau
